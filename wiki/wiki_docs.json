used when an ip is to be evaluated for potential use in a design. a potential product cannot undergo design work with ip under an evaluation license. these requests will be routed to a technical pm first to confirm the evaluation criteria before passing to our biz dev team. a project with this license would never move to tape out until a production or test chip", "Source": "https://wiki.ith.intel.com//display/RDSE/LICENSE+FLOW"}, {"Result:": "when the bill of materials is completely recorded in carbon the soc eip owner needs to submit an hsd license ticket. please be aware that there is around 1 hour delay between entering the ip to a bom in carbon and the ip showing up in the eip control panel for a product. in some cases it is only captured by a more complex synchronization after 24 hours. if it doesn't show up after 24 hours please contact eip operations by filing a ticket http://goto/rdse_services  submit a ticket  external ip  eip operations  ip miscellaneous request and let us know that the ip doesn't show up in the eip control panel. flow advantages the requester records the ip in the bom and launches the license request ticket from the eip control panel (step is easier for requester & the ticket will be more accurate which is obviously better for all stakeholders  requester eip ops eip business managers). the ticket is executed as today and when the ticket is updated the licensing status will be automatically updated in carbon and access permission will be granted in ipx. the diagram below depicts the flow from the control panel to the support ticket and back to the control panel. training use of the tool should be fairly intuitive (similar to the dashboard previously used with the licensing features. a quick run through can be seen in the following recording. eip_owner_council_v_2019_eip_control_panel_us_europe several things to be aware of when requesting a license for synopsys or arc ip start all requests with the product code (see below) one instance per product code -
